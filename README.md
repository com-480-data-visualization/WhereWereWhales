## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.
>
> Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets ([Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), [OpenSwissData](https://opendata.swiss/en/), [SNAP](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/) and [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)), you could use also the DataSets proposed by the ENAC (see the Announcements section on Zulip).

This project will work with the following datasets:
- https://happywhale.com/home
- https://seamap.env.duke.edu/
- Images of cetaceas manually scrapped from Wikipedia
- … many others !!! …

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

This project aims to raise awareness about cetaceans, their philogeny and their current global condition. Knows to be endangered species and very famous for their magnificency, this projects propose a playfull, engaging and interesting way of navigating the history of modern cetaceans, from their biological classification to their reported locations around the world. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

- site de camille qui montre déjà une heatma des détections de cétacées
- tree of life interactive website
- Several websites/plateforms/organization already offer some visualizations of either the ddetected locations of cetaceans or their philogenetic tree but to our knowledge no website rpopose an aggregation of these informaiton into one interactive website. 
- Other inspirations: github/website of the endangered wildlife?

> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
